# Final-Project
What I proposed:
I set out to build a physics-based projectile motion simulator where users can input
variables like velocity, angle, acceleration, and see how an object moves over time.
Whatâ€™s completed:
Input form for initial velocity, launch angle, simulation time.
Animation of a projectile launched in 2D space.
Physics simulation that includes:
Gravity
Propulsion (acceleration at launch)
Air resistance
A visual canvas showing the projectile path.
User input to guess the final position.
Statistics and real-time feedback on guess accuracy![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0293b32d-0263-4f42-af25-f72072570508)
